# Endorsement

### IETF

> A secure statement that an Endorser vouches for the integrity of an Attester's various capabilities such as Claims collection and Evidence signing.

> An Endorsement is a secure statement that some entity (e.g., a manufacturer) vouches for the integrity 
> of the device's various capabilities such as claims collection, signing, launching code, transitioning to other environments, storing secrets, and more.

### TCG

> Endorsers are supply chain entities that supply Endorsements to Verifiers (see Figure 1). Some examples of supply
> chain entities are device manufacturers, original component manufacturers (OCMs), original device manufacturers
> (ODMs), original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), firmware vendors, software vendors, pre-release validators,
> post-release validators, test labs, and quality compliance labs. Some Endorsers define and create components
> and other ingredients that make up a device (or platform, see 2). The device, as the Attester, supplies Evidence
> that a Verifier uses to appraise the Attesterâ€™s trustworthiness. The Verifier compares the Claims in Evidence with
> Endorsements to determine whether the expected Reference Values and Endorsed Values differ from the actual
> values in Evidence.
