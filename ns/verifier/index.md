### IETF 

> The Verifier trusts (or more specifically, the Verifier's security policy is written in a way that configures the Verifier to trust) 
> a manufacturer, or the manufacturer's hardware, so as to be able to appraise the trustworthiness of that manufacturer's devices. 
> Such trust is expressed by storing one or more trust anchors in the Verifier's trust anchor store.
