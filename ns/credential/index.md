# Credential

### NIST

> Evidence attesting to one’s right to credit or authority. 
> In this Standard, it is the PIV Card or derived PIV credential 
> associated with an individual that authoritatively binds an identity 
> (and, optionally, additional attributes) to that individual.

- [NIST.FIPS.201-3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.201-3.pdf)

> An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity 
> (and optionally, additional attributes) to a token processed and controlled by a Subscriber.

> Evidence or testimonials that support a claim of identity or assertion of an attribute and usually are intended to be used more than once.

> An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity 
> - via an identifier or identifiers - and (optionally) additional attributes, 
> to at least one authenticator possessed and controlled by a subscriber. 
> While common usage often assumes that the subscriber maintains the credential, 
> these guidelines also use the term to refer to electronic records maintained 
> by the CSP that establish binding between the subscriber’s authenticator(s) and identity.


> An object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity (and optionally, additional attributes) 
> to a card or token possessed and controlled by a cardholder or subscriber.

> A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a system entity such as a person, an organization, a service, or a device.

### IETF

> credentials: cryptographic objects and related data used to support
> secure communications over the Internet.  Credentials may
> consist of public/private key pairs, symmetric keys, X.509
> public key certificates, attribute certificates, and/or
> application data.  Several standardized formats for the
> representation of credentials exist, e.g., [PKCS12], [PKCS15]
> (see "secured credentials" below).

- [rfc3760#section-2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3760#section-2.1)

> A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with
> two semantic fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with
> its associated signature algorithm).  The signature on the delegated
> credential indicates a delegation from the certificate that is issued
> to the peer.  The private key used to sign a credential corresponds
> to the public key of the peer's X.509 end-entity certificate

- [draft-ietf-tls-subcerts-15#section-3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-subcerts-15#section-3)

> Secure credentials may represent a digital key to a hotel room, a digital key to a door lock in a house or a digital key to a car.

### W3C

> A set of one or more claims made by an issuer. 
> A verifiable credential is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. 
> Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified. 
> The claims in a credential can be about different subjects.

### TCG

> Credential – A credential is an abstract proof that must be instantiated as a certificate before
> it can be exchanged between entities.
